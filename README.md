# Dapr Conversation API Examples

This repository demonstrates how to use Dapr's Conversation API to interact with LLMs (Large Language Models) through a consistent interface. These examples complement the blog post "Building Reliable LLM Applications with Dapr Conversation API" and showcase various capabilities including basic interactions, secure configurations, PII protection, resiliency patterns, and tracing.

## Prerequisites

- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) (v1.12.0+)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (for .NET examples)
- [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) (for VS Code) or cURL

## 1. Basic Conversation with Echo Component

The Echo component provides a simple way to test your Conversation API configuration without requiring external API credentials.

### Configuration

The Echo component is defined in `components/echo.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: echo
spec:
  type: conversation.echo
  version: v1
```

### Running the Echo Component

Start a Dapr sidecar with the Echo component:

```bash
dapr run --app-id test-echo --resources-path ./components --dapr-http-port 3500 -- tail -f
```

### Interacting with the Echo Component

Send a request to the Conversation API using the REST client or cURL:

```http
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/conversation/echo/converse
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "content": "What is Dapr in one sentence?"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: The Echo component will mirror your input message back to you, confirming that your request was properly formatted and the Conversation API is working correctly.

## 2. Using OpenAI with .NET SDK

This example demonstrates using a real LLM provider through the strongly-typed .NET SDK.

### Configuration

The OpenAI component is defined in `components/openai.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: openai
spec:
  type: conversation.openai
  metadata:
    - name: key
      value: <OPENAI_API_KEY>
    - name: model
      value: gpt-4-turbo
    - name: cacheTTL
      value: 10m
```

### Running the .NET Application

Build and run the C# application:

```bash
cd csharp
dotnet build
dapr run --app-id test-csharp --resources-path ../components --dapr-http-port 3500 -- dotnet run
```

**Expected Outcome**: The C# application sends a simple query through the Dapr Conversation API and displays the LLM's response. Note that the same code would work with any configured provider - you could switch from OpenAI to Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, or any other supported provider by simply changing the component configuration, with no application code changes required.

## 3. Using Secure Configurations with Secret Store

This example demonstrates how to securely manage API keys in production environments.

### Configuration

The secure component in `components/secure.yaml` uses a secret store:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: secure
spec:
  type: conversation.openai
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: model
      value: gpt-4-turbo
    - name: key
      secretKeyRef:
        name: api-key
        key: api-key
scopes:
  - secure-app
auth:
  secretStore: localsecretstore
```

The secret store is configured in `components/localsecretstore.yaml` and reads secrets from `components/secrets.json`.

### Running the Secure App

Start a Dapr sidecar with the secure component, using the appropriate app-id to match the scope:

```bash
dapr run --app-id secure-app --resources-path ./components --dapr-http-port 3500 -- tail -f
```

### Interacting with the Secure Component with PII Scrubbing

```http
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/conversation/secure/converse
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "content": "Can you extract the domain name from this email john.doe@example.com ? If you cannot, make up an email address and return that",
      "role": "user",
      "scrubPII": true
    }
  ],
  "scrubPII": true,
  "temperature": 0.5
}
```

**Expected Outcome**:
1. The email address in the input is automatically redacted to `<EMAIL_ADDRESS>` before being sent to the LLM
2. The LLM provides a response without seeing the actual email
3. If you try to call this component from a different app-id (not `secure-app`), the request will be denied

This demonstrates Dapr's ability to:
- Securely manage API keys using secret stores
- Scope components to specific applications for controlled access
- Automatically protect PII data in transit

## 4. Implementing Resiliency Patterns

LLM services are prone to failures like rate limiting, timeouts, and service disruptions. Dapr's built-in resiliency features help manage these issues.

### Configuration

The resiliency configuration in `components/resiliency.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Resiliency
metadata:
  name: llm-resiliency
scopes:
  - secure-app
spec:
  policies:
    timeouts:
      llm-timeout: 60s
    retries:
      llm-retry:
        policy: exponential
        maxRetries: 3
        maxInterval: 10s
        matching:
          httpStatusCodes: 429,500,502-504
    circuitBreakers:
      llm-circuit-breaker:
        maxRequests: 1
        timeout: 300s
        trip: consecutiveFailures > 5
        interval: 0s
  targets:
    components:
      openai:
        outbound:
          timeout: llm-timeout
          retry: llm-retry
          circuitBreaker: llm-circuit-breaker
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- **Timeouts**: If OpenAI takes longer than 60 seconds to respond, Dapr will terminate the request
- **Retries**: If OpenAI returns common error codes (429, 500, 502-504), Dapr will automatically retry the request with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaking**: After 5 consecutive failures, Dapr will "open the circuit" for 5 minutes, preventing further requests that would likely fail

These resiliency patterns are applied automatically when running the `secure-app` from the previous section - the application code doesn't need to implement any retry logic, timeout management, or circuit breaking.

## 5. Enabling Distributed Tracing

For monitoring and debugging production applications, distributed tracing is essential.

### Configuration

The tracing configuration in `components/tracing-config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: daprConfig
  namespace: default
spec:
  tracing:
    samplingRate: "1"
    zipkin:
      endpointAddress: "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans"
```

### Running with Tracing Enabled

Start a Dapr sidecar with tracing enabled:

```bash
dapr run --app-id test-tracing --resources-path ./components --dapr-http-port 3500 --config=./components/tracing-config.yaml -- tail -f
```

**Expected Outcome**: With tracing enabled, all Conversation API calls will generate spans that are sent to Zipkin (or another configured tracing backend). This provides visibility into:
- Request latency (how long each LLM call takes)
- Request flow (the path of the request through your system)
- Errors and their causes

This integration with standard observability tools ensures that your LLM operations can be monitored alongside the rest of your distributed system components.

## Summary

The Dapr Conversation API solves the common challenges of LLM integration:

1. **Provider Abstraction**: Write once, deploy with any LLM provider
2. **Security**: Protect API keys and sensitive data with built-in capabilities
3. **Reliability**: Handle common failure modes automatically with resiliency policies
4. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce costs and latency with caching
5. **Observability**: Monitor LLM operations with industry-standard tools

By leveraging Dapr, you can focus on building LLM-powered applications while Dapr handles the complex cross-cutting concerns that are essential for production deployments.
